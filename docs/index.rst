Welcome to the documentation of MathVizAnimator!
================================================

**MathVizAnimator** is a program to create mathematical based animations and render them into a video file. It is highly inspired by `manim <https://www.manim.community/>`_.

The development is currently at an early stage, but there are already some interesting features. If you want to use the program check out the :ref:`First Steps` and :ref:`User Guide` sections. If you are a developer checkout the :ref:`Developer Guide` section and the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the github repository.

.. warning::
    As stated above the program is currently under development and in an really early (alpha) stage. Be aware that using the program for important or long tasks is not recommended. For example there is no autosave function, not even a check if there are changes when closing the program. Crashes can occur at any time. Please keep that in mind. If you discover an issue (which is very likely) or have an idea for a new feature (which wouldn't surprise me) please have a look at :ref:`Bugs and Feature Requests` section.
